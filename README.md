Describtion:
This simple Python script automates screenshots on Windows using the "win + shift + s" hotkeys. It works as a watchdog for changes in what pixels are displaying. I created it to ease my life of a remote student a little bit. If You have any suggestions to me code, feel free to reach me. Everyone can use it freely.
